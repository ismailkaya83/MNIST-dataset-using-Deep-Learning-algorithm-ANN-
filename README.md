## Project Description
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. 

## Goal
The goal in this projet is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is. For every in the test set, you should predict the correct label.

## Metric
This project is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of images you get correct).

## Data Description
The data contains gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine. Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.
